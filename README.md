# Industrial-Heat-Electrification-Carbon-Reduction-Analysis
This project explores industrial heat demand data to identify high-impact opportunities for electrification and carbon reduction.

- Industrial heat demand and fuel usage analysis
- CO₂ emissions profiling and clustering (K-means)
- Electrification prioritisation using decision tree classification
- ROI and implementation considerations
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualisation
