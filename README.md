# Industrial-Heat-Electrification-Carbon-Reduction-Analysis
This project explores industrial heat demand data to identify high-impact opportunities for electrification and carbon reduction.

This project analyses industrial heat demand data to identify facilities with the highest potential for electrification and carbon reduction. Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand fuel usage, heat intensity, and CO₂ emission patterns across industrial facilities. K-means clustering was applied to group facilities based on heat demand and emission characteristics, followed by a decision tree classification model to predict electrification priority. The analysis supports data-driven decision-making for industrial decarbonization and energy transition planning.
